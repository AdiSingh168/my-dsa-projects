You have:

- A 2D matrix representing the map.

- Each cell contains:

    0: Empty space
    1: Monster (deadly)
    2: Blocked path

- Prince and monsters move 1 unit per time unit in 4 directions (up/down/left/right).

You are given:

    The start position of the prince: (px, py)
    The target position of the princess: (tx, ty)

Goal:
- Determine if the prince can reach the princess without ever being in a cell where a monster could be present at that
  same or earlier time.
