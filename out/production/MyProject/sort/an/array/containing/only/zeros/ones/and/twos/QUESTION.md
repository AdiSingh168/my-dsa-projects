Given an array nums with n objects containing only 0s, 1s and 2s.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.



-   Example 1:
    Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
    Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

-   Example 2:
    Input: nums = [2,0,1]
    Output: [0,1,2]


Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 300
nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.
